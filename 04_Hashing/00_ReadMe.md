# Hashing:
<p>Hashing is to map our provided data according to Keys. 
Keys generated by HashFunction, which generates unique keys 
and map given input according to it.</p>

- Key-Value Pair 
- Data Structure (ADT)
- Efficiently manage and retrieve data.

### Example
Arr = [10, 12, 13, 14,15,16,17,] <br>
HashFunction: <strong>x%2</strong> 

HashMap{ <br>
 0: [10, 12, 14, 16], <br>
 1: [13, 15, 17] <br>
}
