<h1>Arrays:</h1>
<p>Arrays are Collection of Variables of Same Type and Different Types as well.</p>

- Contiguous Memory Blocks
- Not Traditional Arrays like C++ and Java
- Underline Object. For Dynamic Size, JS Engine uses Contiguous Memory with HashMaps
- Elements are Store as Reference like Pointer.

<b>Note:</b> JavaScript arrays can grow and shrink dynamically. 
When elements are added, if there is no available space, 
the engine reallocates memory and copies the existing elements to a new, 
larger block of memory.


<h3>Time & Space Complexity: </h3>
- Linear-Search: O(n)
- Binary-Search: O(logN)
- Push & Pop:    O(1)
- unShift & Shift: O(n)
- insert Middle: O(n)
<br>
- <strong>Space complexity: </strong> O(N)
